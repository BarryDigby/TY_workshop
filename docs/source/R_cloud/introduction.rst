Introduction
============

During the workshop, we will be using the statistical computing software called ``R`` to perform calculations and produce data visualisations.

Fortunately, we have a cloud-based version of R available to us at the following website: `R Studio Cloud <https://rstudio-cloud.com/>`_.

Please follow the steps below to:

1. Create an account

2. Create a project

3. Install some packages

Create Account
==============

Navigate to the `R Studio Cloud <https://rstudio-cloud.com/>`_ website and click on the ``GET STARTED FOR FREE`` button.

Select a free acount. This will provide us with enough resources for the workshop (1 GB RAM, 1 CPU and 25 hours per month). In reality this is a tiny resource allocation - many computational operations in genomics require exponentially more resources which are performed on high performance compute (HPC) clusters or more recently, on the cloud.
